======================

Mew cursor theme for X11.

<img src="preview.png">

## Installation
Run `install.sh`

This will install the theme into `~/.icons`. If you want to install it in another directory (e.g., if you want to install the theme system-wide), run:

```
./install.sh -d <directory>
```

## Manual installation
Copy this directory into `~/.icons` for user-only install, or to `/usr/share/icons/` for system-wide install

## Uninstalling
Run `uninstall.sh`
By default, this will look into `~/.icons`. If you installed it into a different directory, pass it as parameter as with the installation script:

```
./uninstall.sh -d <directory>
```

## Manual uninstallation
Remove the directory you created during installation.
